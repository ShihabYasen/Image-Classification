# Image-Classification

KPMG released a benchmark report in mid-2020, naming Singapore as the top country in the world in terms of development of self-driving cars, as reflected in the government's policy-making and legislation efforts to encourage use of autonomous vehicles.

Self driving car promises to revolutionalise transportation and mobility in the world. But it must first be able to transport people and goods efficiently from point to point and does so in a safe manner. In order to be safe, self driving cars need to be able to detect and classify traffic road signs. 

In Singapore, there is a range or traffic road signs serving various purposes. They range from the green directional signs that tell drivers about upcoming expressway exits, to warning signs that indicate potential elements of danger ahead, such as pedestrian crossings and school zones. 

In this project, you are tasked to develop a simple Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) as a proof-of-concept to classify Singapore's road signs. This Traffic Sign Recognition system must use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the recognition of the signs. 

## Business Requirements: Traffic Signs

The two required traffic signs that you model must detect are the "U-turn sign" and the "Stop" sign. 

**1. U-Turn Sign**

**2. Stop Sign**
